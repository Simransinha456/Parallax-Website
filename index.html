    <h2>Section One - Parallax website</h2>
    <p>
      Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the
      foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a
      more immersive browsing experience.
      Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than
      things farther away, we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.
      With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the world of web design as we know it
      today. By use of parallax, the transition from one image to the next becomes not only smoother, but it also adds a
      sense of depth, as if the images gently glide on top of each other.

    <h2>Section Two - Coding is love</h2>
    <p>
      Coding is similar to learning a new language in that it enables you to speak with computers and build software,
      websites, and applications, just as learning a new language enables you to express yourself and interact with
      people.
      Coding is a creative process that enables you to realise your ideas. Coding is more than just typing lines of
      code. With coding, you have the ability to produce something original and creative.
      Coding allows you to construct practically anything you can think of, so the possibilities are unlimited. Only
      your imagination can constrain what you can create, from mobile apps to artificial intelligence, virtual reality
      to robotics.
      Coding involves a lot of debugging: Debugging is the process of identifying and correcting mistakes.

    <h2>Section Three - Love the nature </h2>
    <p>
      For instance, visiting a river or stream is an opportunity to not only teach children
      The natural world is an incredible wonder that inspires us all. It underpins our economy, our society,
      indeed our very existence. Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air
      we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with.about fish habitat but to explore where their drinking water,
      one of the most precious resources in life, comes from.
      Natural environments can stimulate the senses, providing new and fresh scents, a beautiful array of colours to
      see, a range of textures to touch and a host of calming sounds. We've got to say, there's something special about
      walking through woodlands after a light shower!
      Nature has been found to have a calming quality on our stress levels. Beautiful natural surroundings and scenery
      can feel like worlds away from our home and work life and consequently causes us to put any associated stress on
      the back burner.
